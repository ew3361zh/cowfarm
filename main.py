# John has a cattle farm which consists of a few pens. Each pen houses some cows. 
# The cows in each pen are of the same breed. Each breed of cow eats only one type of feed, 
# yields a certain amount of milk, and generates a certain level of greenhouse gases.

# John has asked you to help him simulate his farm so he can foresee the consequences of his 
# decisions. Develop a code based on OOP to simulate this cattle farm, and run a few scenarios 
# to showcase how it works. Some example features of this simulation are: 

# Pen allocation: What breed is allocated to this pen? How many cows are there?

# Milk yield calculation: How much milk should we expect from each pen? Can you 
# make a time series?

# Greenhouse gas emissions: Overall, how much greenhouse gases does this scenario generate?

# estimates from online searches: 
# 1 dairy cow produces avg of 7.5 gallons milk/day
# 1 liter of milk produces 1.39 kg of CO2 equivalents to the atmosphere
# 1 liter = 0.264172 gallons
# 7.5 gallons of milk produces 2.7539931 kg of CO2 per day


# Cost estimation: Based on the type and amount of the consumed feeds, how much does 
# it cost John to implement this scenario in his farm?
