Python program that takes in and stores information from a dairy farmer 
about their pens and then calculates and compares costs and emissions.

* Create and activate virtual environment using Python 3
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python main.py`

* Unittesting
* `python -m unittest`

* Program uses SQLite to store and fetch farm data so may be necessary to install
